##Cells with more than two recombinants for a locus##

The following cells are likely multiplets or contaminated as they contain more than two recombinants for a locus. Consider removing them from downstream analysis.
None

#Clonotype groups#
This is a text representation of the groups shown in clonotype_network_with_identifiers.pdf.
It does not exclude cells that only share heavy chain and not light chain if Summarise is run with --IGH_networks.

#Cells with no reconstructed sequences#
None
